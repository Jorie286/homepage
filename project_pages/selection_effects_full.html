<h3 align="center">Abstract</h3>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em">Pulsar surveys rely on highly accurate periodicity exhibited by most pulsars to determine if a re-
peating signal is emitted by a pulsar. However, it is difficult to accurately detect and measure the
properties of a pulsar when it is part of a binary system. We use selection effects to determine if a
pulsar in a binary system would be detected by a given survey. We use emulated data for our pulsar
population. These calculations are important because pulsars are vital tools in many area of astron-
omy and astrophysics. We find that by using Python, we can accurately reproduce the results of the
psrEvolve pipeline for calculating the selection effects. Building on this base, we incorporate further
selection effects to get more accurate detections.</p>

        <h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2em">Double neutron star (DNS) systems – or generally, binaries containing a neutron star and another compact
object – are thought to form from the separate evolution of two massive stars in a binary pair. Each star undergoes its supernova explosion, and if both remnants
remain gravitationally bound, the outcome can be a neutron star–white dwarf binary, a neutron star–black hole
binary, or a double neutron star binary (Chattopadhyay et al. 2020). However, this sequential evolution does not
guarantee a surviving binary; one of the supernovae can impart a natal kick strong enough to unbind the system 
or even cause the two stellar remnants to merge into a single object.</br>
If a binary does remain intact through two supernova events, detecting and measuring the neutron star(s) in
such a system is considerably more challenging than for an isolated neutron star. The presence of orbital motion can Doppler-shift and modulate the observed
pulsar signal, complicating both detection and parameter estimation. These difficulties in discovering and timing DNS systems are well documented – for example, Bagchi
et al. (2013) details the challenges of detecting pulsars in eccentric binaries, and Section 3.9 of Lyne and Grahm-Smith (2012) discusses how binary dynamics can hinder
pulsar observations.</br>
A rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron star
is observed as a pulsar, which emits beams of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles. As the star
spins, these beams sweep across the sky; if one of the
beams crosses Earth’s line of sight, telescopes record a
regular series of pulses. An isolated pulsar typically exhibits extremely stable pulse arrival times, with pulse
periods on the order of a few seconds or less. This remarkable regularity allows pulsars to be identified in survey data with high confidence, as genuine pulsar signals
appear as strictly periodic flashes separated by a constant interval.</br>
Large pulsar surveys rely on the precision of this
periodic timing to distinguish real pulsar signals from
random noise. In practice, search algorithms look for
strictly periodic sequences of pulses. However, when a
pulsar resides in a binary system, its pulse timing is periodically perturbed by the orbital motion. Even slight
deviations from perfect periodicity, caused by the pulsar’s changing line-of-sight velocity in a binary, can prevent standard search pipelines from classifying the signal
as a pulsar. This selection effect means that some pulsars in binaries may be overlooked in survey data (see
Section 3.9 of Lyne and Grahm-Smith 2012 for an indepth discussion). </br>
To assess potential biases in pulsar observations, we
calculate the selection effects introduced by the survey
for a given pulsar. These calculations account for a variety of factors that can diminish or distort a pulsar’s
signal, including propagation through the interstellar
medium (e.g. dispersion and scattering by free electrons), receiver noise, and other instrumental or environ-
mental effects. In the case of a pulsar in a binary system,
we also account for modulation due to orbital dynamics,
for example, changes in pulse arrival times caused by the
binary motion, which may be exacerbated if the orbit is
eccentric or if the companion’s gravity alters the spindown behavior of the pulsar. By modeling these effects,
we can infer which pulsars might be missed by a given
survey and correct for biases in the measured properties
(period, flux, distance, etc.) of those that are detected.
Accounting for selection effects in this way allows for a
more accurate determination of pulsar intrinsic param-
eters. This is crucial because pulsars serve as precise
astrophysical tools in many areas (from testing general
relativity to probing the interstellar medium), and un-
corrected biases could significantly skew any scientific
results derived from pulsar data.</br>
In this work, we test our selection-effects pipeline –
a modernized version of the psrEvolve code (Oslowski
et al. 2011) – using synthetic binary populations generated by the POSYDON simulation framework (Fragos
et al. 2025). We simulate a population of binary star
systems that evolve into DNS systems, recording all relevant stellar and orbital parameters for the resulting
neutron stars. Given the characteristics of a representative pulsar survey, we then compute the selection effects
for each pulsar in our simulated population to evaluate
which systems would be detectable and how their observed parameters might be biased by survey sensitivity
limits and observational systematics.

        <h3 id="Methods">Calculating Selection Effects</h3>
        <p>To evaluate the selection effects of a pulsar system and
assess whether a survey would detect it, we compare the
modeled pulsar’s luminosity with the survey’s minimum
detectable luminosity at the pulsar’s distance. If the
pulsar’s luminosity is below this threshold, it is classified as undetected. Detection outcomes are encoded
as a binary variable, with 1 indicating detection and 0
indicating non-detection. </br>
These detection outcomes do not take into consideration the probability that the pulsar will be seen by the
survey. To accurately determine the likelihood of a survey detecting the pulsar, we need to consider the fraction
of the sky covered by its beam. This is called the beaming fraction. In general, a larger beam width makes detecting
the pulsar easier since the survey is more likely to cover
an area of the sky that overlaps with the beam.
These calculations are applied to each neutron star,
whether in isolation or in a binary system.
