<h3 align="center">Abstract</h3>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em">Pulsar surveys rely on highly accurate periodicity exhibited by most pulsars to determine if a re-
peating signal is emitted by a pulsar. However, it is difficult to accurately detect and measure the
properties of a pulsar when it is part of a binary system. We use selection effects to determine if a
pulsar in a binary system would be detected by a given survey. We use emulated data for our pulsar
population. These calculations are important because pulsars are vital tools in many area of astron-
omy and astrophysics. We find that by using Python, we can accurately reproduce the results of the
psrEvolve pipeline for calculating the selection effects. Building on this base, we incorporate further
selection effects to get more accurate detections.</p>

        <h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2em">Double neutron star (DNS) systems – or generally, binaries containing a neutron star and another compact
object – are thought to form from the separate evolution of two massive stars in a binary pair. Each star undergoes its supernova explosion, and if both remnants
remain gravitationally bound, the outcome can be a neutron star–white dwarf binary, a neutron star–black hole
binary, or a double neutron star binary (Chattopadhyay et al. 2020). However, this sequential evolution does not
guarantee a surviving binary; one of the supernovae can impart a natal kick strong enough to unbind the system 
or even cause the two stellar remnants to merge into a single object.</br>
If a binary does remain intact through two supernova events, detecting and measuring the neutron star(s) in
such a system is considerably more challenging than for an isolated neutron star. The presence of orbital motion can Doppler-shift and modulate the observed
pulsar signal, complicating both detection and parameter estimation. These difficulties in discovering and timing DNS systems are well documented – for example, Bagchi
et al. (2013) details the challenges of detecting pulsars in eccentric binaries, and Section 3.9 of Lyne and Grahm-Smith (2012) discusses how binary dynamics can hinder
pulsar observations.</br>
A rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron star
is observed as a pulsar, which emits beams of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles. As the star
spins, these beams sweep across the sky; if one of the
beams crosses Earth’s line of sight, telescopes record a
regular series of pulses. An isolated pulsar typically exhibits extremely stable pulse arrival times, with pulse
periods on the order of a few seconds or less. This remarkable regularity allows pulsars to be identified in survey data with high confidence, as genuine pulsar signals
appear as strictly periodic flashes separated by a constant interval.</br>
Large pulsar surveys rely on the precision of this
periodic timing to distinguish real pulsar signals from
random noise. In practice, search algorithms look for
strictly periodic sequences of pulses. However, when a
pulsar resides in a binary system, its pulse timing is periodically perturbed by the orbital motion. Even slight
deviations from perfect periodicity, caused by the pulsar’s changing line-of-sight velocity in a binary, can prevent standard search pipelines from classifying the signal
as a pulsar. This selection effect means that some pulsars in binaries may be overlooked in survey data (see
Section 3.9 of Lyne and Grahm-Smith 2012 for an indepth discussion). </br>
To assess potential biases in pulsar observations, we
calculate the selection effects introduced by the survey
for a given pulsar. These calculations account for a variety of factors that can diminish or distort a pulsar’s
signal, including propagation through the interstellar
medium (e.g. dispersion and scattering by free electrons), receiver noise, and other instrumental or environ-
mental effects. In the case of a pulsar in a binary system,
we also account for modulation due to orbital dynamics,
for example, changes in pulse arrival times caused by the
binary motion, which may be exacerbated if the orbit is
eccentric or if the companion’s gravity alters the spindown behavior of the pulsar. By modeling these effects,
we can infer which pulsars might be missed by a given
survey and correct for biases in the measured properties
(period, flux, distance, etc.) of those that are detected.
Accounting for selection effects in this way allows for a
more accurate determination of pulsar intrinsic param-
eters. This is crucial because pulsars serve as precise
astrophysical tools in many areas (from testing general
relativity to probing the interstellar medium), and un-
corrected biases could significantly skew any scientific
results derived from pulsar data.</br>
</p>

        <h3 id="Methods">Calculating Selection Effects</h3>
        <p>In this work, we test our selection-effects pipeline –
a modernized version of the psrEvolve code (Oslowski
et al. 2011) – using a generated population of pulsars.
We create a population of binary pulsar systems within a
given set of restrictions for their parameters. Given the
characteristics of a representative pulsar survey, we then
compute the selection effects for each pulsar in our population to evaluate which systems would be detectable
and how their observed parameters might be biased by
survey sensitivity limits and observational systematics. </br>
To evaluate the ability of a survey to detect a pulsar in
a single star or binary system, we calculate four types of
selection effects. These include the minimum observable
luminosity, the beaming fraction, pulsar death lines, and
Bagchi correction. For each selection effect (except the
pulsar beaming fraction) it is determined if the pulsar is
detected or not. By sorting out all of the non-detections
and compiling these effects, we investigate the population of detectable pulsars. </br>
However, to accurately determine the likelihood of a
survey detecting the pulsar, we need to consider the fraction of the sky covered by its beam. This is the beaming
fraction.</br>
In general, a larger beam width makes detecting the pulsar easier since the survey is more likely to cover an area
of the sky that overlaps with the beam.
These calculations are applied to each neutron star,
whether in isolation or in a binary system.

        <h3 id="Results">Results</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2em">
          In both the Python and psrEvolve code (Oslowski
et al. 2011) the radiometer equation is implemented
first. This is
the only selection effect implemented in psrEvolve, so to
compare the performance of the Python code to those
of psrEvolve, we must only consider this effect. When
we calculate all of the resulting selection effects, we used
parameters from the SKA survey (Shao et al. 2015).
To visually check the distribution of detections returned by python against those given by psrEvolve, we
plot P-Pdot diagrams. The P-Pdot diagram illustrates where
a pulsar is in it’s life by relating its rotational period
(P) to the change in its rotational period (Pdot). We plot
the P-Pdot diagram of detections and non-detections for
the results of both the psrEvovle and Python code only
considering the radiometer equation. By comparing the
distribution of ”detected” pulsars we can get an idea of
how well the python pipeline is reproducing the results
from psrEvolve. In the following figure we removed all the pul-
sars which fall below the theoretical death lines given
by Chattopadhyay et al. (2020) and Rudak and Ritter
(1994). We are not considering the radio efficiency parameters yet. We see that while
the distribution of non-detections does not match up
well, the overall distribution of detections is good. It
can also be observed that the Python pipeline produces
fewer non-detections than the psrEvolve code. This is
due to a bug in psrEvolve which caused the effective
pulse width to be a much higher value and held it constant. Due to the effective pulse width dependence on
period, this should not be the case. This is resolved
in the Python code and gives it a higher detection rate
because the threshold for detectability is lower. </br>

Figure 1. Pulsar spin period against spin down period.
The distribution of non-detections are marked for both the
Python and psrEvolve (Oslowski et al. 2011) outputs. We
cut off everything below the theoretical death lines in Chat-
topadhyay et al. (2020). </br>

We statistically check the accuracy of the output from
python using the KS test. This test measures how sim-
ilar the underlying distribution of two samples are and
returns the result as a p value. A p value close to 1
means that the two test samples follow a very similar
distribution. A p value close to 0 means that the distri-
bution of the samples are not significantly similar. We
want a p value close to 1 since we need the distribution
of detected values by the python pipeline to be very sim-
ilar to the detected values returned by psrEvolve. We
found a p-value for the SKA survey of 0.981 which means
that the Python pipeline reproduces the underlying dis-
tribution the C results very well when only using the
radiometer equation for selection effects (Figure 3).</br>

Figure 2. Cumulative distribution of detections returned
by the Python pipeline compared to the detections returned
by the C pipeline. In both of these, the only selection effect
that is considered is the radiometer equation. </br>
      
The second effect that we consider are the death lines
of the pulsars. These death lines remove the ”dead”
pulsars which are no longer emitting strong radio signals
and can therefore not be detected by a survey. The first
P-Pdot that we consider removes all of the pulsars
which do not have sufficient power in the spin period
and magnetic field to accelerate particles and produce
the radio emission beams. The second death shown in
Figures 1 and 3 marks the theoretical limit where pulsars
are unable to produce the election and positron pairs
necessary to sustain their radio emissions.
However, radio pulsars have been detected beyond the
pair production limit. We use a comparison radio effi-
ciency factor to the maximum efficiency. This more accurately determines if the pulsar is radio dead by directly determining if it has enough
power to sustain radio emissions. As illustrated in Figure 3, this soft cutoff allows some pulsars to fall below
the pair production death line, allowing for a more accurate distribution of detections.</br>

Figure 3. Spin period against spin down rate of the generated population of pulsars. In this plot, we only considered the minimum observable luminosity
      and the death lines.</br>
We have determined that the Python and psrEvolve
codes are returning similar results. We now incorporate
the effects of the beaming fraction in the detection of pulsars. We weight the detections from the Python code by the beaming fraction to
more realistically represent the distribution of detectable
pulsars. This distribution is a more realistic example of
what we might detect because the pulsars which have
shorter spin periods are easier to detect than those with
longer spin periods. The shorter the spin period, the
more likely it is for the pulsar to be detected by the
survey because the pulses are more frequent. This is
illustrated in Figure 4. Detections occur frequently at
lower spin periods but taper off as the spin periods increase. </br>

and unweighted python detections. The weights used are the
beaming fractions of the pulsars.</br>
      
The fourth selection effect that we consider is the
Bagchi correction (Bagchi et al. 2013). We investigate how this correction affects the distribution of detections using a fixed orbital
period of 3 days for all pulsar binaries in the system.
Eccentricity and spin period of the pulsars are allowed
to vary. Examining Figure 5, we see that most of the detections are occurring at high eccentricities. These high
eccentricities with short orbital periods make the pulsar
easier to detect because it does not have as much time to
get gravitationally perturbed by it’s more massive companion. In an eccentric orbit the pulsar spends much
of the time at aphelion, away from the massive companion. The signal we receive will only occasionally get
slightly perturbed when the pulsar sweeps by the massive companion at perihelion. This means much of the
time, the pulsar is emitting a steady signal, detectable
by a survey. </br>

curated so that each binary system has an orbital period of

        <h3 id="Discussion">Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2em">We have developed a pipeline to determine selection
effects for a population of binary pulsars. This pipeline
was created in Python and builds on the psrEvolve
pipeline (Oslowski et al. 2011). In the new Python
pipeline we include four types of selection effects. These
include the minimum detectable luminosity of a pulsar (given by the radiometer equation), the
beaming fraction, the pulsar death lines and Bagchi correction. </br>
We run generated data through both pipelines and
test the similarity of the results to ensure the Python
code is correctly implementing the radiometer equation.
We test the similarity of the outputs using K-S testing.
The returned p-value indicates that the overall distribution of results from psrEvolve match up well with those
from our Python code.</br>
Finally, we test how implementing the other types of
selection effects changes the detected population of pulsars. </br>
In future work, we will use POSYDON simulations
Fragos et al. (2025) to generate realistic pulsar data with
which we will test our selection effects code. The binary pulsar simulations through POSYDON give data
in which the pulsar parameters are correlated, unlike the
distribution of pulsars used to test the Python pipeline
in this work. Applying the selection effects on realistic
data will allow us to investigate how they affect a more
accurate distribution.</br>
